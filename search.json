Check the box “Create a git repository”. Choose which version of R you are using but don’t use “renv”. Open the new project.\nCreate a “data” subfolder (use the “Explorer” pane from the left side bar to navigate through your files). This is a good place to store your data later.\nCreate an “R” folder where you can later save your R scripts.\nOpen the already existing .gitignore file. This is a file where you specify which files to NOT include for version control. It is already populated to avoid adding some unnecessary files (and hence to avoid unintentionally sharing those files with the rest of the world).\nYou should never share any sensitive data (and most healthcare related data is considered sensitive) so lets add that we do not want to commit anything which is later found in “data” subfolder. Simply type “data/*” on a new line in the .gitignore and save the file.\nAdd some data to the data folder by exectuting write.csv(iris, \"data/iris.csv\") from the R console.\nCheck that the file name of the new file in the Explorer pane is in gray. This means that this file will not be included in later git commits (because it is found in a folder which is ignored by git).\nOpen the README.md file and make some changes to that file.\nCommit your changes (as you did for the previous crap repo).\nPress “Publish to GitHub” (you might need to log in) and select public repo. If everything works you should get a notification in the lower right corner of Positron that the repo has now been published and you can click a link to open it in your browser; do that!\nOpen the README.md file in the browser to have a look\nPress “edit this file” (the pencil symbol to the upper right of the file).\nMake some changes to the file in the online text editor and press “Commit changes …”. Write a message and click “Commit changes”.\nGo back to Positron and look at the source control pane. Press “Sync changes”.\nThe changes you made online should now be visable locally as well.\n\nTo share your repo using GitHub (or Git alone or another provider such as GitLabs or Bitbucket) makes it easy to collaborate with others and also to work with your projects from different computers. This is often done for software development, including for R packges. To collaborate within projects including sensitive research data, however, is often more difficult. But for this course we will only use synthetic data and can therefore be less careful for now."
