## Positron extensions

Positron is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It makes it easy to write and execute R code, manage projects, and visualize data. It is made by Posit (formerly RStudio) PBC and is free for individual use.

Positron is based on Code OS, an open source version of VS Code from Microsoft. As such, it supports a wide range of [extensions](https://open-vsx.org/) and customization options. 

We will use [GitHub Pull Requests](https://open-vsx.org/extension/GitHub/vscode-pull-request-github). Search for it in the Extensions pane in Positron and install it.
